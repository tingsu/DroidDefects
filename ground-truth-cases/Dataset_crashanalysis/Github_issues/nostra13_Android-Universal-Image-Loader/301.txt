The issue is on [this line](https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader/blob/v1.8.3/library/src/com/nostra13/universalimageloader/core/ImageLoaderEngine.java#L73).  By looking over the source, it doesn't seem possible for a null task to be supplied, so it seems as though the view is being destroyed or the back button is being pressed before the executor runs, so the `taskExecutorForCachedImages` is null at this point.
