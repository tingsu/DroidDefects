[Here](https://github.com/mscdex/node-imap/issues/523) a similar problem was reported and a workaround could be to "limit the number of connections" as is discussed there. Would you at K-9 be willing to work on such a workaround? If not, is there anything else I could try to make outlook365 via IMAP work?
