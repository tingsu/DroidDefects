Markers should remain stationary at their originally added lat/long.

_What steps will reproduce the problem?_ 
- 1a. Download the APK from:
  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46443835/OneBusAway/UI_redesign/onebusaway-android-oba-google-debug.apk

or
- 1b. Build, install, and run the develop branch of OneBusAway:
  - a. `git clone https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android.git`
  - b. `git checkout develop`
  - c. `gradlew installObaGoogleDebug`
  - d. `adb shell am start -n com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot/org.onebusaway.android.ui.HomeActivity`
- 1. Browse to any supported city (e.g., Seattle or Tampa), and watch the green bus stop markers jump around on the map

I should add that I can't _always_ reproduce this.  It seems like everything works fine for a time, but then when the markers start jumping around they don't stop.

_Marker Implementation Details_

The code that loads the icons used for the 9 marker types (8 directions + no direction) is here:
https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android/blob/develop/onebusaway-android/src/google/java/org/onebusaway/android/map/googlemapsv2/StopOverlay.java#L169

I'm using this drawable:
https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android/blob/develop/onebusaway-android/src/main/res/drawable/map_stop_icon.xml

...which is a number of shapes - this creates the main green circle with the white outline and the drop shadoes.  Then, I'm drawing the direction arrow on top of this drawable for each of the 8 directions - code for drawing directions is here:

https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-android/blob/develop/onebusaway-android/src/google/java/org/onebusaway/android/map/googlemapsv2/StopOverlay.java#L202

In the code to load the icons, I'm caching the `BitmapDescriptor` returned from `BitmapDescriptorFactory.fromBitmap()` for each of the 9 icon types on first load, so this isn't done each time a marker is put on the map.

I also saw the app crash to "Unfortunately, OneBusAway has stopped." and saw this exception in Logcat after letting the app sit on the map screen for a few minutes:

I've seen this on an LG G4 and Nexus 6.  More details on LG device is below.
- LG G4 LS991 with Android 5.1 (LS991ZV4)
- Google Play Services client library version = `compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:7.5.0'` and `compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:7.8.0'`
- Google Play Services version on the device - Google Play Services 7.8.99 (2134222-440)
- Android SDK Version: `compileSdkVersion 21 buildToolsVersion "21.1.2"`

This issue hasn't always existed, which makes me believe it was introduced during an update to Android Google Play Services/Maps at some point.
