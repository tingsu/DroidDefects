I've pasted the stack trace below; the crash seems to be happening due to calling `mCol.getDecks().confForDid(did)` where `did` is null. After looking at the code, it's not obvious to me why it doesn't fail MORE (i.e. whenever there are a few levels of nesting), but on the surface the code appears to be the same as Anki desktop.

(Note however that Anki desktop **doesn't** crash with the same collection, so there's obviously a subtle difference somewhere)

I can get the collection to open by changing it to `confForDid(node.did)`, but that's not what Anki desktop does, so I'm not sure if that's correct or the best solution. 

@hssm could you please take a look?
