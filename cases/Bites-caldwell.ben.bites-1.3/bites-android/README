Bites is an organiser for cooks. The key feature of Bites is the creation of relationships between ingredients used in recipes and ingredients kept in inventory, allowing automatic generation of a shopping list based on planned meals and items that are low in stock.

Planned features of future releases will include:

	*Peer to peer sharing of recipes over bluetooth

	*A browseable central recipe repository allowing users of Bites to upload and download their recipes

	*A recipe of the day feed
