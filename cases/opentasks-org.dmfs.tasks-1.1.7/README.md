STR:

1. Open the app. 

2. Click the "Task List" so that it unwinds, and gives access to the 'quick add' button (the little plus at the right of the screen).

3. Click this 'quick add' button (not the large, main 'add' floating button at the bottom the screen), and type any name in the "Title" field.

4. Click "Save", then press the home button very quickly (timing is important, when the dialog has changed to "Task created", but before the dialog has disappeared).
