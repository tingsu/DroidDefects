     * Notes:
     * <ol>
     * <li>This is a top-level interface for normalizing the image intensity by
     * mapping the image so that the background is near the input value 'bgval'.
     * <li>The input image is either grayscale or rgb.
     * <li>For each component in the input image, the background value is
     * estimated using a grayscale closing; hence the 'Morph' in the function
     * name.
     * <li>An optional binary mask can be specified, with the foreground pixels
     * typically over image regions. The resulting background map values will be
     * determined by surrounding pixels that are not under the mask foreground.
     * The origin (0,0) of this mask is assumed to be aligned with the origin of
     * the input image. This binary mask must not fully cover pixs, because then
     * there will be no pixels in the input image available to compute the
     * background.
     * <li>The map is computed at reduced size (given by 'reduction') from the
     * input pixs and optional pixim. At this scale, pixs is closed to remove
     * the background, using a square Sel of odd dimension. The product of
     * reduction * size should be large enough to remove most of the text
     * foreground.
     * <li>No convolutional smoothing needs to be done on the map before
     * inverting it.
     * <li>A 'bgval' target background value for the normalized image. This
     * should be at least 128. If set too close to 255, some clipping will occur
     * in the result.
     * </ol>
